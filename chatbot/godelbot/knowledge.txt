    Determined is an open-source deep learning training platform that makes building models fast and easy. Determined enables you to: Train models faster using state-of-the-art distributed training, without changing your model code, Automatically find high-quality models with advanced hyperparameter tuning from the creators of Hyperband, Get more from your GPUs with smart scheduling and cut cloud GPU costs by seamlessly using preemptible instances, Track and reproduce your work with experiment tracking that works out-of-the-box, covering code versions, metrics, checkpoints, and hyperparameters.  Determined integrates these features into an easy-to-use, high-performance deep learning environment â€” which means you can spend your time building models instead of managing infrastructure.  To use Determined, you can continue using popular DL frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch; you just need to update your model code to integrate with the Determined API. Determined AI was acquired by HPE.
    Hyperparameter optimization finds a tuple of hyperparameters that yields an optimal model which minimizes a predefined loss function on given independent data.
